# 0x02. Shell, I/O Redirections and Filters

## Description

This project focuses on learning how to use I/O redirections and filters in shell scripting. Each task includes writing a shell script that performs specific operations related to file manipulation, input/output redirections, and text processing using basic shell commands.

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Use commands such as `cat`, `head`, `tail`, `find`, and `echo`.
- Redirect standard input and output using `>`, `>>`, `<`, and `|`.
- Work with special characters in file names.
- Manipulate file content from the command line.
- Understand how to write efficient one-liner scripts.
